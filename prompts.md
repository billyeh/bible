# Prompt 1
I'm trying to write a simple Bible reading app.
I'd like for this Bible reading app to help me read the Bible on a schedule, daily. For now, I'd like to have the ability to set a goal to finish certain books of the Bible by a certain date. The app should then be able to calculate how many verses I'll need to read per day to finish those books by that date. Then, it will show me a notification of the current verse that I need to read. When I click a button on that notification, it will mark that verse as read. The notification will then update to show me the next verse, until I've finished reading that day's verses.
I'll need to come up with a data structure to store my Bible reading schedule(s). I might be doing a few schedules at a time. I also need to store my progress (the verses I've read, and when I read them).Â 
In the future, I may want to support a different type of schedule. For example, maybe instead of setting a goal to read a certain set of books by a certain date, I want to just read a certain number of verses per day and that's all. We don't have to implement that just yet, but it's something to keep in mind.
Can you help me come up with a data model for this app?

# Response 1
Data Model Overview
This model is designed around two main concepts: Schedules (your reading plans) and Progress (the verses you've completed). We will use two collections to store this information.

Collection: schedules
This collection will store the details of each reading plan. A single document in this collection represents one reading schedule, like "Finish the Gospels by December 31st."
id (Auto-generated by the database)
userId (string): The ID of the user who owns this schedule. This allows each user to have their own set of plans.
name (string): A descriptive name for the schedule, like "New Testament 90-Day Challenge."
type (string): The type of schedule. This is important for future flexibility. For your first version, the value would be "books_by_date". Later, you could add "verses_per_day".
startDate (timestamp): The day the schedule begins.
endDate (timestamp): The target date to finish the schedule.
books (array of strings): A list of the books included in this reading plan, e.g., ["Matthew", "Mark", "Luke", "John"].
dailyVerseGoal (integer): This is a calculated field that the app will determine based on the total verses in the selected books divided by the number of days between the startDate and endDate.
currentBook (string): The current book to read from.
currentChapter (integer): The current chapter to read from.
currentVerse (integer): The current verse to read from.

Collection: progress
This collection will track the verses you've actually read. Each document in this collection will represent a single verse that has been marked as complete.
id (Auto-generated by the database)
userId (string): The ID of the user.
scheduleId (string): A reference to the schedule document this progress belongs to.
book (string): The book of the Bible that was read, e.g., "John".
chapter (integer): The chapter that was read, e.g., 3.
verse (integer): The verse that was read, e.g., 16.
timestamp (timestamp): The date and time the verse was marked as read.

How the Model Works
Calculating the Goal: When a user creates a new schedule, the app would calculate the total verses in the specified books and set the dailyVerseGoal on the schedule document.
Tracking Progress: Each time a user clicks the "mark as read" button, a new document is added to the progress collection with the relevant book, chapter, and verse details.
Checking Daily Progress: To see if a user has met their daily goal, the app would query the progress collection for all documents with the correct scheduleId and a timestamp from the current day. If the number of documents returned is equal to or greater than the dailyVerseGoal, the goal for the day is met.
Updating the Notification: The app would reference the currentBook, currentChapter, and currentVerse fields on the schedules document to know which verse to display in the notification. After a verse is marked as read, the app would update these three fields to the next sequential verse.
