1001001|1|1|1|In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
1001002|1|1|2|And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
1001003|1|1|3|And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
1001004|1|1|4|And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
1001005|1|1|5|And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
1001006|1|1|6|And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
1001007|1|1|7|And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
1001008|1|1|8|And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
1001009|1|1|9|And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
1001010|1|1|10|And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
